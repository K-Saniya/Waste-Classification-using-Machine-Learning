# Waste-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
### Real-time Waste Classification using TensorFlow

#### Problem Statement
Real-time waste classification into biodegradable and non-biodegradable using the TensorFlow library by building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

#### Introduction
This project addresses the pressing issue of waste segregation, particularly in urban areas where a significant portion of waste remains unsegregated and untreated. In India, for instance, approximately 50 percent of waste is not properly segregated. 

#### Solution Overview
We have developed a proof-of-concept solution in the form of an admin-end application. This application can be deployed at waste segregation units to classify waste into two broad categories: biodegradable and non-biodegradable. The solution leverages TensorFlow, a popular machine learning library, to achieve this functionality. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**: Utilizing a dataset containing over 15000 images (link to Kaggle dataset).
2. **Model Training and Building**: Developing a CNN model for waste classification.
3. **Live Image Capture**: Employing pre-trained weights and Google Colab's image capture feature for real-time image processing.
4. **Prediction**: Implementing binary classification to categorize waste as either biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
